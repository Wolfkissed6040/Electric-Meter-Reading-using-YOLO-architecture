# Atomatic Electric Meter reading using YOLO architecture

Accurate electric meter reading is crucial for efficient energy management and billing processes. This paper introduces a
comprehensive approach to automatic meter reading, leveraging the YOLOv8 model for meter display extraction and evaluating various
YOLO architectures for digit recognition. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that YOLOv9 achieves the highest
accuracy and efficiency, with a precision of 0.917, recall of 0.899, and mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.919. Our comparative analysis
explores the strengths and weaknesses of each YOLO variant, considering factors such as detection speed, accuracy, and robustness.
The results indicate that YOLOv9 outperforms other variants, offering promising potential for applications in electric meter reading
systems. These results contribute significantly to the advancement of automatic meter reading technologies, providing valuable insights
for researchers in computer vision and energy management fields. The research not only improves the accuracy and efficiency of electric
meter reading processes but also lays the groundwork for the development of more effective systems. With implications for smart city
infrastructure and energy co
